{-| A library for navigating and updating immutable trees. The elements in
the tree must have the same type. The trees are implemented in a Huet
Zipper fashion.

# Future work
Might be able to integrate existing [Rose Tree](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/TheSeamau5/elm-rosetree) to work with the Zipper.
Wanted the first version to be self contained.

{-| The necessary information needed to reconstruct a MultiwayTree as it is
navigated with a Zipper. This context includes the datum that was at the
previous node, a list of children that came before the node, and a list of
children that came after the node.

{-| A list of Contexts that is contructed as a MultiwayTree is navigated.
Breadcrumbs are used to retain information about parts of the tree that move out
of focus. As the tree is navigated, the needed Context is pushed onto the list
Breadcrumbs, and they are maintained in the reverse order in which they are
visited

allow us to continue navigation through the rest of the tree.

{-| Separate a list into three groups. This function is unique to MultiwayTree
needs. In order to navigate to children of any Tree, a way to break the children
into pieces is needed.

The pieces are:
* before: The list of children that come before the desired child
* focus: The desired child Tree
* after: The list of children that come after the desired child

These pieces help create a Context, which assist the Zipper
